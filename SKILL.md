# /pr-review-respond

Handle all code review comments on a GitHub PR: categorize into fixed / needs-fix / wontfix, implement fixes, test, commit, push, reply in Chinese, and resolve all threads. Supports multi-round review loops to handle AI review bot feedback on pushed changes.

## When to use

- A PR has pending review comments that need to be addressed
- The user says "处理审查意见", "回复 review", "resolve PR comments", etc.
- Review feedback from any review tool (codereviewbot, human reviewers, etc.)

## When NOT to use

- The PR has no review comments yet — nothing to respond to
- You don't have write access to the repository
- The review comments require discussion with the original author before acting
- The skill is being invoked on a fork without upstream write permissions

## Usage

```
/pr-review-respond <owner/repo> <PR number>
```

If no arguments given, detect from `git remote get-url origin` and the current branch's associated PR:

```bash
# Auto-detect PR number from current branch
gh pr view --json number --jq '.number'
```

## Workflow

### Pre-Step — Initialize session state

At the start of every invocation, initialize:

- `round = 1`
- `max_rounds = 3` (configurable via environment variable `PR_REVIEW_MAX_ROUNDS`)
- `processed_thread_ids = []` — set of thread IDs already replied to and resolved in prior rounds
- `round_summary = []` — structured log of what each round accomplished

### Loop body: Steps 1–4

The four steps below form the body of the multi-round loop. After completing Step 4, a decision is made whether to continue to the next round.

### Step 1 — Fetch all review comments

Use `gh api` to get all pull request review comments:

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<PR>/comments --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | {id, body: .body[0:100], path, commit_id, user: .user.login, created_at, in_reply_to_id, node_id}'
```

Also fetch review threads to check what's already resolved:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query($owner:String!,$repo:String!,$pr:Int!) {
  repository(owner:$owner,name:$repo) {
    pullRequest(number:$pr) {
      reviewThreads(first:100) {
        nodes { id isResolved comments(first:1) { nodes { id } } }
      }
    }
  }
}' -F owner=<owner> -F repo=<repo> -F pr=<PR>
```

> **Note**: The GraphQL query paginates `first:100` threads. For PRs with more
> than 100 review threads, add pagination logic using the `after` cursor and
> `pageInfo.hasNextPage` fields. In practice, PRs rarely exceed 100 threads.

If this is round 2 or later, filter the fetched threads:

1. Remove any thread whose `id` is already in `processed_thread_ids`
2. Remove any thread whose `isResolved` is true (resolved externally)
3. The remaining threads are "new unresolved threads" for this round

Map each remaining comment's `node_id` to its GitHub comment `id` (numeric) for cross-referencing in commit messages.

### Step 2 — Categorize each comment

For each top-level comment (not a reply):

| Category | Criteria | Round 1 Action | Round 2+ Action |
|----------|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Already fixed** | The fix exists in a prior commit (pre-existing or from a prior round) | Reply explaining which commit, then resolve | Reply with "已在第N轮修复：..." referencing the prior round's commit SHA |
| **Needs fix** | Valid issue, code change required | Fix → test → commit → push → reply → resolve | Same as round 1 |
| **Wontfix** | Invalid, out of scope, or design choice | Reply with rationale, then resolve | Same as round 1 |

For round 2+, when checking "already fixed": read the relevant file at the relevant lines. If the code already reflects the fix (i.e., the fix was applied in a prior round's commit), classify as "already fixed" and reference the prior round's commit SHA.

If after categorization there are zero "needs fix" and zero "already fixed" comments, skip Step 3 (no code changes needed) and proceed to Step 4 to reply to and resolve wontfix threads.

### Step 3 — Implement fixes

For each "needs fix" comment:

1. Read the relevant file(s)
2. Make the minimal code change
3. Run the project's test suite. Auto-detect the test runner from:
   - `package.json` scripts (e.g. `npm test`, `npx vitest`, `npx jest`)
   - `*.csproj` / `*.sln` (use `dotnet test`)
   - `Makefile` test targets
   - `Cargo.toml` (use `cargo test`)
   - `go.mod` (use `go test ./...`)
   - If the test command is unclear, ask the user which command to use.
4. Commit with a descriptive message following the format in "Commit message style".
   The "Addresses review comments:" line **must** include the comment ID(s) from each
   review comment addressed by this commit. Example:
   ```
   fix(logger): prevent stale file writer accumulation

   Addresses review comments: #12345, #12346

   Clean up writers keyed by dates other than today to avoid
   resource leaks in long-running processes.

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 <noreply@anthropic.com>
   ```
   If one commit addresses multiple review comments, list all their IDs comma-separated.
5. Push

Group related fixes into sensible commits. Each commit should fix a cohesive set of issues and list all comment IDs it addresses.

### Step 4 — Reply to each comment on GitHub and resolve

For each review thread, reply individually using GraphQL:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input: {
    pullRequestReviewThreadId: "<thread_id>",
    body: "<reply text in Chinese>"
  }) {
    comment { id body }
  }
}'
```

**Reply format rules:**
- **Already fixed (first round)**: "已修复：<what was done>。Commit: <short SHA>（文件：<path>，对应评论 #id）"
- **Already fixed (subsequent rounds)**: "已在第N轮修复：<what was done>。Commit: <short SHA from prior round>（文件：<path>，对应评论 #id）"
- **Wontfix**: "不采纳：<reason>"
- Always mention the commit SHA (short form, 7 chars) if a fix was made
- Always append file path and comment ID reference: "（文件：<path>，对应评论 #id）"
- Always reply in Chinese (中文)
- Keep replies concise — one to two sentences
- **DO NOT add a general summary comment at the PR level** — reply only under each specific comment thread

After replying to a thread, resolve it immediately via GraphQL:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  resolveReviewThread(input: { threadId: "<thread_id>" }) {
    thread { id }
  }
}'
```

Process one thread at a time: reply → resolve → next thread. Do NOT batch resolve all threads at the end.

If `resolveReviewThread` returns an error (e.g., the thread was already resolved externally), note it and continue to the next thread — no action needed.

### After processing this round's threads

1. For every thread replied to in this round, add its `thread.id` to `processed_thread_ids`
2. Record in `round_summary`:
   - Round number
   - All commit SHAs created in this round
   - Mapping of comment_id → commit_sha for each fix
   - List of wontfix comment IDs

### Loop exit / continue decision

After completing the loop body (Steps 1–4), decide whether to continue to the next round:

1. If `round >= max_rounds`: exit. Report "已达到最大轮次（{max_rounds}轮）。"
2. If zero commits were pushed this round (only wontfix replies): exit. No new code to review.
3. Otherwise, wait for AI review bot:
   a. Report: "等待AI审查机器人重新审查...（等待{interval}秒）"
   b. Sleep for `PR_REVIEW_POLL_INTERVAL` seconds (default 45, configurable via env var)
   c. Fetch fresh thread list via the same GraphQL query from Step 1
   d. Identify unresolved threads whose IDs are NOT in `processed_thread_ids`
   e. If none found: "未发现新的审查评论，退出循环。"
   f. If found: "发现 {N} 条新的审查评论，进入第 {round+1} 轮处理。" Increment `round` and go to Step 1.

### Step 5 — Summary report

After the loop exits, compile and display a summary:

- **总完成轮次**: N
- **总提交数**: N
- **已修复的评论**: list of #comment_id → commit_sha mappings
- **不采纳的评论**: list of #comment_id
- **未处理的评论**: if any threads remain unresolved due to max_rounds, list them with a note suggesting the user re-run the skill or handle manually

### Step 6 — Update project documentation

If the project maintains a `CLAUDE.md` or similar convention file, follow its documentation update procedures. Common patterns include:

- `docs/change-log.md` — append fix summary to today's entry
- `docs/progress.md` — update recent progress and today's entry
- `CHANGELOG.md` — add entry under Unreleased

Read the relevant files first, then edit only the sections that need updating. If no documentation conventions exist, skip this step.

## Commit message style

Use this format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description in imperative mood>

Addresses review comments: #comment_id1, #comment_id2

<optional body explaining WHY>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

The "Addresses review comments:" line is **required** for any commit that fixes review feedback. It lists the GitHub comment IDs addressed by this commit, separated by commas.

Types: `fix` (default), `test`, `refactor`, `chore`

## Key rules

1. **Minimal changes** — fix only what the review comment asks for, no extra refactoring
2. **Test before commit** — always run relevant tests, confirm pass
3. **Chinese replies** — all GitHub comment replies must be in Chinese
4. **Group related fixes, annotate comment IDs** — combine related fixes into sensible commits (don't create a commit per comment). Each commit's message MUST include an "Addresses review comments:" line listing the comment ID(s) it addresses.
5. **Reply under each specific comment** — DO NOT add a general summary comment at the PR level. Reply individually under each review thread using `addPullRequestReviewThreadReply`.
6. **Reply then resolve immediately** — process one thread at a time: post reply, then immediately resolve that thread. Do NOT batch resolve all threads at the end.
7. **Multi-round loop** — after resolving all threads in a round, wait for the AI review bot to post new comments (45s default, configurable via `PR_REVIEW_POLL_INTERVAL`). Process up to `max_rounds` rounds (default 3). If no new unresolved threads appear, exit early. Log a summary of all rounds at the end.
8. **Bidirectional referencing** — every fix commit message must reference the comment IDs it addresses (via "Addresses review comments:" line). Every reply about a fix must reference the commit SHA, file path, and comment ID. This creates a complete traceability chain: comment ↔ commit ↔ reply.
9. **Don't push without testing** — if tests fail, fix the issue and re-test
10. **Resolve ALL threads** — even wontfix threads must be resolved after replying

## Environment variables
